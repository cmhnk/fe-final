# Final Project: Automated Insights Front End Course

Huge thanks to Rachel Tublitz for teaching the course and for the [Webpack, Heroku + Express sample repo](https://github.com/tublitzed/webpack2-express-heroku-starter.git").
This is a very basic sample app to get you started using [Webpack 2](https://webpack.js.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and is setup to deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

This app uses Babel, Sass, SVG, Webpack, and CSS Animations. 


App is deployed at https://corinnehenk.herokuapp.com/
